### A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.
Images should...
  - Be relevant
  - Convey information
  - Convey the right mood 
  - Be instantly recognisable 
  - Fit the color palette

- The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.
- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
- You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs

### Color can really bring your pages to life.

- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

#### When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.
The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:
● Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)
● Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)

- There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
- There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
- You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
