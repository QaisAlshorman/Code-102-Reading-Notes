### 1: HTML

HTML is used to 
create web pages. You will see that you start by writing down the words you want to appear on your page. You then add tags or elements to the words so that the browser knows what is a heading, where a paragraph begins and ends, and so on.
The rest of this section introduces the tags you have at your disposal to create web pages, grouped into chapters on: text, lists, links, images, tables, forms, video audio and flash, and miscellaneous elements.

### 2: CSS
CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages. We then go on to look at the wide variety of CSS properties you can use in your CSS rules.
These properties generally fall into one of two categories:Presentation: How to control things like the color of text, the fonts you want to use and the size of those fonts, how to add background colors to pages (or parts of a page), and how to add background images.
Layout: How to control where the different elements are positioned on the screen. You will also learn several techniques that professionals use to make their pages more attractive.

### Structure
- Understanding structure
- Learning about markup
- Tags and elements
HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages There are several different elements. Each  element has an opening tag and a closing tag.Tags act like containers. They tell you 
something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

#### If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85091281/122686642-df2a3500-d21a-11eb-95de-ba51c0cd4402.png)

It is a good idea to add comments to your code because, no matter how familiar you are with the page at the time of writing it, when you come back to it later (or if someone else needs to look at the code), comments will make it much easier to understand.


#### Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character).It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).
The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element.


#### Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that contain information that is more important than others and want to distinguish these elements, or you might want to differentiate between links that point to other pages on your own site and links that point to external sites. To do this you can use the class attribute. Its value should describe the class it belongs to. In the example on the left, key paragraphs have a class attribute whose value is important.

### New Html5 LayoutElements 
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
-  The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google
 
  
  It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style. 
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
