#### You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. 

authors are increasingly using the float property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:
1: The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image 

2: New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

It is also common to add a margin to the image to ensure that the text does not touch their edges.

By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the displayproperty with a value of block. Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:
1: On the containing element, you can use the text-alignproperty with a value of center.
2: On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

The background-image
property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.The path to the image follows the letters url, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes.

The background-repeatproperty can have four values:repeat
The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it 
is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).repeat-xThe image is repeated horizontally only.
repeat-yThe image is repeated vertically only no-repeatThe image is only shown once.
The background-attachment property specifies whether a background image should stay in one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page.
It can have one of two values:fixedThe background image stays in the same position on the page.scrollThe background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.
When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-positionproperty to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed. This property usually has a pair of values. The first represents the horizontal position and the second represents the vertical.

When a single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a sprite. You can add the logo and other interface elements, as well as buttons to the image.
