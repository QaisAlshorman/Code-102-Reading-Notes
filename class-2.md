When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.

#### ● Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
#### ● Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on
#### HTML has six "levels" of headings:

#### - HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

#### - They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

#### CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

#### The key to understanding how CSS works is to  that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.

#### CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

#### - CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
#### - Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
#### - Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
#### - Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
#### - CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

#### HOW I WRITE A SCRIPT TO A WEBPAGE ?

It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 
The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
