#### Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.
#### type of the links :
● Links from one website to another

●Links from one page to another on the same website

● Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page

● Links that open in a new browser window

● Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone
#### Writing Links 
Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

  ### Directory Structure 
 On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.

  #### Relative URLs
  Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files
  When you are linking to a page 
on your own website, you do not need to specify the domain name. You can use relative URLswhich are a shorthand way to tell the browser where a page is in relation to the current pag

#### Email Links
  
  To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a>element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to
 
  #### pening Links ina New Window
  If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.
  
  #### Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page
  
  At the top of a long page you might want to add a list of contents that links to the corresponding sections lower down. Or you might want to add a link from part way down the page back to the top of it to save users from having to scroll back to the top.

  Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link will go to. You do this using the id attribute (which can be used on every HTML element)
  
  The value of the id attribute should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character) and, on a single page, no two id attributes should have the same value.
  
  To link to an element that uses an id attribute you use the <a>element again, but the value of the href attribute starts with the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute of the element you want to link to.
  
  #### Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page
  
  The href attribute will contain the address for the page (either an absolute URL or a relative URL), followed by the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute that is used on the element you are linking to.
  
- Links are created using the <a> element.
- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
  
  
#### Controlling the Position of Elements
 CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the positionproperty in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

  #### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

  ####what is the object ?
  Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
