### There are lots of occasions when we 
 #### need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:
 
● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.

● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point 
(rather than characters that indicate order).

● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the 
definitions for each of those terms.

### There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition. 
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.
### boxes dimensions
 #### width, height
By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.

When you use percentages, the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window or, if the box is encased within another box, it is a percentage of the size of the containing box.

When you use ems, the size of the box is based on the size of text within it. Designers have recently started to use percentages and ems more for measurements as they try to create designs that are flexible across devices which have different-sized screens.
#### Overflowing Content
#### overflow :
he overflow property tells the 
browser what to do if the content 
contained within a box is larger 
than the box itself. It can have 
one of two values:
#### hidden
This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
#### scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.On the left, you can see two boxes whose contents expand beyond their set dimensions.

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

#### DATA TYPES 
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.
